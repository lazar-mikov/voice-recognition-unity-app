# voice-recognition-unity-app

This is a Unity app (Android only) developed for the interactive film #murder.
The app uses voice recognition to trigger notifications on the viewers android smart phone in order to 
simulate a conversation between the viewer and the film character. 

For voice recognition the app uses Watson asistant. The voice logic is located in: Assets - Unity-sdk-4.7.1 - examples - example streaming.cs
Currently the trigger word is "Perfect"

The other necessairy code is in the Example Streaming scene. 

The app features a custom developed bot. Bot logic is in BotUI.cs.

Smartphone camera logic is located in camera.cs

The project needs to be opened in unity studo in order to work and it can be tested on an android smartphone.
The functions of this app only make sence if they are paired with the short film #murder wich you can find on https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/503545807

Hope you enjoy :)
